Artificial neural networks can also be thought of as learning algorithms that model the input-output relationship. Applications of artificial neural networks include pattern recognition and forecasting in fields such as medicine, business, pure sciences, data mining, telecommunications, and operations managements. [...] An artificial neural network transforms input data by applying a nonlinear function to a weighted sum of the inputs. The transformation is known as a neural layer and the function is referred to as a neural unit. The intermediate outputs of one layer, called features, are used as the input into the next layer. The neural network through repeated transformations learns multiple layers of nonlinear features (like edges and shapes), which it then combines in a final layer to create a prediction [...] Once the artificial neural network has been trained, it can accurately predict outputs when presented with inputs, a process referred to as neural network inference. To perform inference, the trained neural network can be deployed in platforms ranging from the cloud, to enterprise datacenters, to resource-constrained edge devices. The deployment platform and type of application impose unique latency, throughput, and application size requirements on runtime.  For example, a neural network',\n",
